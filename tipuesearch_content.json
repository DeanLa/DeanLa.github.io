It happens when there are too many leading zeros before the significant digit, yet too loo little for matplotlib to intelligently shift to scientific notation (about 4-7 leading zeroes). That result in the tick labels overlapping and making everything unreadable. It is not that much of a problem on exploratory code, but when I need a paper-worthy chart, it's an issue. In [1]: import numpy as np # import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt % matplotlib inline In [13]: # Create random data of x = np . random . normal ( loc = 0.0000035 , scale = 0.000002 , size = 5000 ) print ( x ) [ 3.84484418e-06 2.91685770e-06 3.88867504e-06 ..., 4.26532717e-06 3.18812399e-06 4.30168460e-06] I have 5000 samples from the normal distribution. The samples have about 6 leading zeroes. Next, I'll create a histogram for the samples. In [14]: fig , axs = plt . subplots ( figsize = ( 6 , 4 )) axs . hist ( x ) plt . show () You can see how the labels of the x axis are overlapping and you can't understand any of them. I wanted a fast yet elegant way to deal with this. I didn't want to mess with rcParams for now (Although probably better in the long run). .get_xticks() method returns a numpy array of all the labels. Now with the easy slicing mechanism of numpy arrays I can get all even places. .set_xticks() method can set the new ticks to that value. In [15]: fig , axs = plt . subplots ( figsize = ( 6 , 4 )) axs . hist ( x ) axs . set_xticks ( axs . get_xticks ()[:: 2 ]) plt . show () There are better practices if you have many ticks on a many axes object, but this is a nice, elegant hack if you need it for a few paper-worthy charts, without the hassle.","tags":"Hacks","url":"spacious-matplotlib-tickss.html"}]}
