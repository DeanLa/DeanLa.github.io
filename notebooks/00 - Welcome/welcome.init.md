Welcome.
It seems like everybody has a blog these days. And that's amazing, blogs are my greatest source for learning. As an aspiring data scientist I find myself everyday learning something new. Reading the docs is great but for many packages, the **docs are sometimes written as if only software engineers is reading them**, and I'n not one. Blogs come to save the day as they give many examples - sometimes toy examples and sometimes real world examples. both are __amazing__.

Yet, it sometimes seems like everybody who has a blog is a professional and is in the business for 10 years. It seems like every person who once ran a [decision tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) also has vast knowledge about object-oriented design, working with APIs and mastering regex. I know this is not the case in practice, but the fact is - although blogs are an amazing resource, they can sometimes be __intimidating__: "I'll never be in the level of this person".

I am 28, and although I've coded some in my bachelors, and am no stranger to algorithmic thinking, my real __experience in programming started two years ago__ and only as a hobby. I only started real coding (for my master's thesis) a few month ago.

This blog is about things I learn. I learn as I go, and I try to make it __as little intimidating as possible__. Maybe in 2 years' time it will have posts about expert and specific knowledge, but the blog will always keep the history of me finding out my way.

I work mostly with Python, and sometimes with R.

```python
print "hello world"
```
