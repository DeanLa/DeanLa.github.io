Summary: Some of my talks about disease modeling.

During the last few month I was lucky enough to travel around the world and talk about my university work:
Disease modeling with Python. Back then, we would have thought that only a few month later this will be all too relevant.


## @Pydata Warsaw
Had a great time talking about how to use python with pymc3 and scipy to model disease behavior
and find optimal vaccination strategies. [PyData Warsaw](https://pydata.org/warsaw2020/)
 is an awesome event at an awesome city.

## @Olmait Tbilisi
I was invited by [Olmait](https://www.linkedin.com/company/olmait/) to Tbilisi, Georgia
to speak in front of the local data-science community about disease modeling,
pandas, numpy, pymc3 and much more.
Georgia is not (yet) known for its tech scene, but after being exposed to some awesome people,
I think it's will be a good bet saying they have a bright future.

## @PyCon/PyData Israel
This was actually given first, in fron of a local crowd with a home court advantage.
