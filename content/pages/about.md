Title: About Me

I am currently a data scientist at SentinelOne, a rapidly-growing cyber AI company.
I am interested in data science, machine learning, deep learning, Python scientific programming, data visualizations, and Bayesian modeling.
 Specifically, I am a pandas enthusiast, and maintain [dovpanda](https://github.com/dovpanda-dev/dovpanda)
- a pandas companion package that helps data scientists with writing better, more concise pandas code.
